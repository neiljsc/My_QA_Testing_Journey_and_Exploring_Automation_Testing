My QA Testing Journey and Exploring Automation Testing

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I document my journey from manual testing to automation testing. This repository includes my learning process, test plans, test cases, automation frameworks, and examples of how I am applying automation tools like Selenium, Python, Behave, and Allure.

Introduction

As a QA Engineer with a focus on manual testing, I've decided to explore automation testing to improve my skill set and increase efficiency. This repository documents my journey, the challenges I face, and the solutions I implement while transitioning to automation testing. Currently, I am working with Selenium, Python, Behave, and Allure to create an automation framework for a sample web application, JPetStore.
